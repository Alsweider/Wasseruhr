# Wasseruhr
This programme notifies you when it is time to drink another glass. Once the total amount, glass size, and drinking frequency are set, the countdown begins and continues until the entire quantity has been consumed. As a notification, an optional beep may sound, or a pop-up window may appear.

# Important

The human body can only process a limited amount of fluid per hour. Generally, about 2 litres of water per day are recommended; however, this may vary significantly depending on physical activity and temperature. If large amounts of water are consumed too quickly without adequate sodium intake (salt), there is a risk of [water intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication).
Use of this programme is at your own risk and should be discontinued immediately if symptoms such as discomfort, muscle twitching, head pressure, dizziness, confusion, visual disturbances, fatigue, chills, or similar occur.
